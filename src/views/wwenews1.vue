  <p>IShowSpeed reunited with Randy Orton for Episode 5 of Speed Goes Pro. In the episode, the former WWE Champion takes Speed to the WWE Performance Center, putting him through training to see if he has the makings of a future Superstar.</p>
  <p>Sheamus also appears, offering additional guidance as Speed prepares for a match to prove himself to Orton. Viewers see Speed working with Fit Finlay and Matt Bloom at the Performance Center, who teach him the ropes of the ring. The reunion comes after Orton delivered an RKO to IShowSpeed at WrestleMania 40.</p>
  <p>Orton comes back later in the episode to show Speed how to properly take a chair shot. Toward the end, Speed steps into the ring for a match against WWE developmental talent Anthony Luke, who ultimately pins Speed for the win.</p>
  <p>Despite the loss, Speed earns Orton’s respect. He said, “Speed, it takes a very long time to get good at your craft. You’ve got a long way to go. But without a shadow of a doubt, I think you do have what it takes to be a WWE Superstar.”</p>
  <p>He continued, “Mentally, he’s there. Physically, he’s got everything it takes. If he wants to stick with this journey, through hard work and dedication, he could one day be a full-time WWE Superstar if he wants it.”</p>
