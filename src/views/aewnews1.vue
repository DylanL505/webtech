  <p>Fightful Select has confirmed that AEW recently inked a deal with former WWE Women's Tag-Team Champion Kayden Carter - she's been wrestling as Lacey Lane since leaving Triple H's league on 2 May. According to reports, Lane impressed all of the right people during appearances on ROH in September, and she also made "a good impression" when wrestling Mercedes Mone on the 7 October edition of All Elite flagship show Dynamite.</p>

  <p>So, AEW boss Tony Khan has made the call to bring Lacey in permanently. She's now officially part of the company's women's division.</p>

  <p>Lane (as Carter) enjoyed a fruitful spell in WWE developmental wing NXT before being called up to the main roster alongside her tag-team partner Katana Chance in 2023. Together, Carter and Chance were pushed all the way to the top of the women's tag game for a brief spell, but they never seemed able to sustain that success.</p>

  <p>At one stage, creative seemed unsure whether they were all in on a party girl gimmick for the pair. It fizzled out after a few matches and vignettes on Raw. Both were subsequently traded to SmackDown earlier this year, but they'd never really get started before being deemed surplus to requirements.</p>

  <p>This is Lacey's next big chance to make a mark and put things right. Post-WWE release, Lane spoke about feeling like she'd been "held back" before. She's looking for any opportunity to regain a lost "spark", and would love to show what she's capable of inside the ring. Hopefully, Khan will give her the platform to do just that.</p>
