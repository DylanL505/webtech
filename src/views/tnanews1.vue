  <p>A second major title change unfolded during week two of NXT: Gold Rush. TNA Knockouts World Champion Kelani Jordan defended her title in a Triple Threat match against Jordynne Grace and Léi Yǐng Lee.</p>

  <p>In the closing moments, Lee struck Jordan with a kick to the back of the head, securing the pinfall and returning the Knockouts World Championship to a TNA talent. After the match, TNA President Carlos Silva — seated ringside beside Tommy Dreamer — personally presented the title to the new champion.</p>

  <p>Lee previously wrestled for WWE from 2017 to 2024 under the name Xia Li before being released. She will make her first title defense at TNA Final Resolution on December 5th. Her opponent will be decided the night prior, when Dani Luna faces Lee’s partner, Xia Brookside, in a singles match.</p>

  <p>Kelani Jordan’s reign as Knockouts World Champion concludes at 53 days.</p>
